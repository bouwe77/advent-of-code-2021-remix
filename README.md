# Advent of Code 2021

First time I participate in Advent of Code, and a great opportunity to try [Remix](https://remix.run)! ðŸ’¿

# My solutions

You can find the code for my solutions in the [solutions folder](https://github.com/bouwe77/advent-of-code-2021-remix/tree/main/app/solutions).

# About this app

As I am learning TypeScript, and Remix at the moment, creating a Remix app where I solve my puzzles with Typecript feels like a great combination. ðŸ’¯
